# Storyboard-for-ID
IPad app designed to create an Instructional Design Storyboard and save information to CoreData
I am building this app so that instructor can take the ID iPad and fill in the form to start the instructional design process
for a class or module.
It will have the abilitiy to include a picture or video to get the creative process started.
The first version will uuse coredata on the local iPad
Future versions may connect to a hosted database...thinking big!
